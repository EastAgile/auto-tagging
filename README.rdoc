= AutoTagging

A Ruby wrapper library for multiple auto tagging services such as Alchemy, Delicious, Yahoo Content Analysis and Open Calais.
Learn more about these services at:

http://www.alchemyapi.com/

http://www.opencalais.com/

http://developer.yahoo.com/contentanalysis/

https://delicious.com/developers

Just by specifying a paragraph or an url , meaningful tags/keywords will return in form of an array

== Examples :

  AutoTagging.get_tags(url: "www.rubygems.org")
  results : ["gem hosting service", "available gems", "Ruby community", "contributor", "API", "RubyGems.org", "site", "changes", "information"]

  AutoTagging.get_tags("Tens of thousands of Rails applications are already live. People are using Rails in the tiniest part-time operations to the biggest companies.")
  results : ["Rails applications", "biggest companies", "Tens", "thousands", "People", "Software" "Web application frameworks", "Computing", "Web 2.0", "Ruby on Rails", "Labor"]


== Installation
  gem install 'auto_tagging'

or add to Gemfile:
  gem 'auto_tagging'

== Usage
Configure:
Specify one or many services you want to use, for example:
  AutoTagging.services = [{:alchemy => "alchemy_api_key"}]
or
  AutoTagging.services = [{:open_calais => "open_calais_api_key}]
or
  AutoTagging.services = [:yahoo]
or
  AutoTagging.services = [{:delicious => {"delicious_username" => "delicious_password"}}]
or
  AutoTagging.services = [{:open_calais => "open_calais_api_key}, {:alchemy => "alchemy_api_key"}, "yahoo"]

Note: The result will be the combination of the results return from these services calls but it will slow down the run time

For PARAGRAPH , (Delicious service doesn't support this)
  AutoTagging.get_tags("Put content here")

For URL , (OpenCalais service doesn't support this)
  AutoTagging.get_tags(url: "rubygems.org")
