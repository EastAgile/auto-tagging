              the community setting.
              The HPA's head of flu surveillance Dr Richard Pebody said: \"While the frequency
              of oseltamivir resistance in community settings has increased slightly since the 2009-10
              pandemic from 1-2% in the 2012/13 flu season, rates of detection remain low.\"
              Swine flu (H1N1) infected a fifth of people during the first year of the pandemic in 2009, data suggest.
              It is thought the virus killed 200,000 people globally.
              Although the pandemic has been declared by officials as over, the virus is still circulating.
              During the pandemic, the H1N1 virus crowded out other influenza viruses to become the dominant virus. This is no longer the case. Many countries are reporting a mix of influenza viruses."
